# snake-game
 ### A basic but fully functional snake game
 
 This is a game I designed while learning how to code in Python. Although fairly simple, I made sure to make the game feel complete and polished.
 
 Uses [Turtle Graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle) as the base for the GUI.

 Uses [winsound](https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html?highlight=winsound#module-winsound) for processing the game audio.
